## Data Types
- A data type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values.
	- Primitive data types
		- int, double, boolean, char, long, short, float
	- Non-primitive data types
		- String and Scanner
			- Operations are more complex (richer set of operations)
- We want to fill these data types with values:
	- ex. int i = 5;
	- String word = ("Now is the time");
- We can use classes to reference certain data types.
	- ex. 1100111001 would be the memory address for int i, while String would be in the memory address 1100111101
- String Operations
	- String otherWord = word.substring(0,5);
	- length()
	- charAt(i)
	- indexOf("t")
	- replace("t","T")
	- concat() (shortcut is +).
		- You would need to *save* the location of these actions.
			- Ex. char letter = word.chatAt(b)
			- Ex. int loc = word.indexOf("t")
			- Ex. String upper = word.replace("t", "T")
- Making new Objects
	- We can use constructors to create new objects.
		- Ex. String otherWord = new String("blah");
			- This is the long handed form of an already simplified shortcut:
				- String otherWord = ("blah");
	- String[] theWords = words.split(" ");
